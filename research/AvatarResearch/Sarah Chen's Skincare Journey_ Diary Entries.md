# Sarah Chen's Skincare Journey: Diary Entries

## Entry 1: Before Using the Product
*March 15th, 2:47 AM*

I'm writing this in the dark glow of my phone screen because sleep has abandoned me again. My face feels like a battlefield tonight – tender, angry, unpredictable. I touched the new cluster of bumps along my jawline earlier and winced, not just from the physical sting but from the familiar punch of defeat that follows me everywhere these days.

The bathroom mirror has become my enemy. This morning, I stood there for twenty-three minutes – yes, I counted – staring at my reflection under the harsh LED lights I installed thinking they'd help me see my skin "more clearly." What a joke. They just illuminate every flaw with surgical precision, turning my face into a topographical map of failure. The red marks from last week's breakout are still there, stubborn purple shadows that makeup can't quite hide. I traced them with my finger like battle scars, wondering what I did wrong this time.

My skincare cabinet looks like a graveyard of broken promises. Bottles and tubes and jars, each one representing hope that curdled into disappointment. The $150 vitamin C serum that made my skin burn. The "holy grail" moisturizer from Reddit that gave me the worst breakout of my adult life. The prescription retinoid that turned my face into sandpaper for three months before I gave up. They're all there, half-empty monuments to my stupidity, mocking me every morning and night.

I've become obsessed with my own face in the most unhealthy way possible. I check my skin compulsively – in the rearview mirror at red lights, in the black screen of my laptop during video calls, in every reflective surface I pass. My coworkers probably think I'm vain, but it's the opposite. I'm terrified. Terrified that the angry red bump I felt forming this morning has erupted into something visible. Terrified that my skin will betray me during tomorrow's client presentation. Terrified that I'm twenty-eight years old and still can't figure out something as basic as washing my face.

The worst part isn't even the physical discomfort, though that's real enough. It's the mental prison I've built for myself. I spend hours every night falling down rabbit holes of skincare advice, my eyes burning from blue light as I scroll through endless Reddit threads and YouTube videos. "What worked for me might not work for you," they all say, which is just another way of saying "good luck figuring this out on your own." I've memorized ingredient lists like they're scripture. I can recite the pH levels of different cleansers and explain the difference between AHA and BHA, but none of this knowledge has translated into actual results.

Last week, I had a breakdown in the Sephora skincare aisle. Literally. I stood there surrounded by hundreds of products, each promising to be the solution I've been searching for, and I started crying. Not the pretty, single-tear kind of crying you see in movies, but the ugly, shoulder-shaking kind that makes other shoppers avoid eye contact. A sales associate approached me with that practiced concern they probably learn in training, and I couldn't even explain what was wrong. How do you tell someone that you're overwhelmed by choice? That you've tried so many things that you don't trust your own judgment anymore? That you're afraid of spending another $60 on something that might make everything worse?

The anxiety follows me everywhere now. I wake up each morning with a knot in my stomach, dreading the moment I have to look in the mirror. Will today be a good skin day or a bad one? There's no way to predict it, no pattern I can discern despite months of trying to track everything. I've kept journals, taken photos, noted what I ate and how I slept and where I am in my cycle, but my skin remains as mysterious and volatile as the weather.

Work has become a minefield of self-consciousness. I catch myself touching my face during meetings, checking for new bumps or feeling the texture of my skin through my makeup. I've started scheduling important calls for days when I think my skin might be clearer, which is insane because I can never actually predict when that will be. Last month, I almost called in sick the day of our biggest client presentation because I woke up with a painful cyst on my chin. I ended up going, but I spent the entire meeting convinced everyone was staring at it, even though it was probably barely visible under my concealer.

Dating has become complicated in ways I never expected. I've started declining last-minute plans because I need time to assess my skin situation and adjust my makeup accordingly. I've turned down weekend trips because I'm afraid of how my skin will react to different water, different air, different stress levels. My boyfriend tries to be understanding, but I can see the confusion in his eyes when I spend forty-five minutes in the bathroom before we go anywhere. He tells me I'm beautiful, that he doesn't notice my skin issues, but I know he's just being kind. How could he not notice when it's all I can think about?

The financial cost is staggering, but the emotional cost is worse. I've spent over $800 in the past year on products that promised to change my life, and I have nothing to show for it except a bathroom cabinet full of regret. But it's not just the money – it's the hope. Each new product represents a fresh start, a chance that this time will be different. And each failure chips away at my confidence a little more.

I've started avoiding certain lighting situations. I know exactly which restaurants have unflattering bathroom mirrors and which coffee shops have windows that show every flaw. I've memorized the lighting in my office building – the elevator is kind, the conference room is brutal, the bathroom on the third floor is somewhere in between. This is not how a grown woman should be living her life, cataloging light sources like a vampire afraid of the sun.

The worst moments come at night, like right now, when I'm lying in bed and my face feels tight and uncomfortable. I can feel new bumps forming under the surface, like tiny time bombs waiting to explode. I know I shouldn't touch them, but my fingers find them anyway, pressing and prodding, trying to predict when they'll surface and how bad they'll be. It's a form of self-torture, but I can't stop myself.

I've become an expert at reading my own skin like a fortune teller reads tea leaves, looking for signs and omens in every pore. A slight redness here might mean a breakout is coming. A rough texture there could indicate I'm using too many actives. But I'm always wrong. My skin defies every prediction, every careful calculation, every desperate attempt at control.

The isolation is perhaps the cruelest part. I feel like I'm the only person my age still struggling with this. My friends casually mention their simple routines – cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen – and I want to scream. How is it so easy for them? What am I missing? What fundamental truth about skincare am I too stupid to understand? I've started declining invitations to pool parties and beach trips, not because I'm ashamed of my body, but because I can't bear the thought of being makeup-free in front of others.

Social media has become a special kind of torture. Everyone's skin looks perfect in their selfies, glowing and smooth and effortless. I know about filters and editing, but the doubt creeps in anyway. Maybe some people really do have naturally perfect skin. Maybe I'm just unlucky. Maybe I'm doing something fundamentally wrong that everyone else figured out years ago.

I've googled "how to fix bad skin" so many times that it's probably affecting my targeted ads. I've watched hundreds of YouTube videos, read thousands of Reddit comments, bookmarked dozens of articles about skincare routines and ingredient interactions. I could probably teach a college course on skincare theory at this point, but theory and practice are two very different things. Knowledge without results is just another form of failure.

The irony isn't lost on me that I work in marketing, where I help brands tell compelling stories about their products, but I can't figure out which skincare story to believe. I know how marketing works, I understand the psychology of beauty advertising, but I'm still susceptible to every "before and after" photo and every testimonial that promises transformation. Desperation makes you gullible, even when you should know better.

Tonight, as I write this, my face feels like it's pulsing with its own heartbeat. The new breakout along my jawline is tender to the touch, and I know it's going to be worse tomorrow. I have a video call with our biggest client at 10 AM, and I'm already planning how to angle my camera to minimize the damage. This is my life now – strategic lighting and careful angles and the constant, exhausting performance of pretending everything is fine.

I'm tired of being at war with my own face. I'm tired of the uncertainty, the expense, the mental energy that this consumes every single day. I'm tired of feeling like I'm failing at something that should be basic self-care. Most of all, I'm tired of hope. Because hope is what keeps me buying new products, trying new routines, believing that the next thing will be different. And hope is what gets crushed every time I look in the mirror and see the same problems staring back at me.

Tomorrow I'll wake up and do it all again – the careful examination in the mirror, the strategic makeup application, the constant checking throughout the day. Because what else can I do? Give up? Accept that this is just how my skin is? I'm not ready for that kind of surrender, not yet. But I'm running out of fight, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

The clock on my phone says 3:23 AM now. I should try to sleep, but I know I'll just lie here thinking about my skin, planning tomorrow's damage control, wondering if there's something out there that could actually help me. Something I haven't tried yet. Something that might finally, finally work.

But hope is dangerous when you've been disappointed this many times. Hope is what got me into this mess in the first place.



## Entry 2: During Their First Use of Product
*April 3rd, 11:47 PM*

I downloaded GlowAI three days ago, and I'm still not sure if I'm being smart or setting myself up for another spectacular disappointment. My finger hovered over the "Get Started" button for a full ten minutes before I finally pressed it, like I was about to jump off a cliff. Which, in a way, I was. Another leap of faith into the skincare void that has swallowed so much of my money, time, and sanity.

The setup process was... different. Instead of asking me to choose from a dropdown menu of skin types (oily, dry, combination – as if my skin could be reduced to such simple categories), it wanted to know everything. When did I last break out? What does my stress level look like this week? Where am I in my cycle? What's the weather been like? Have I been sleeping well? It felt invasive at first, like the app was prying into corners of my life that I didn't think were relevant to skincare.

But then something clicked. For the first time in years, something was asking the right questions. Not just "what's your skin type?" but "what's your life like?" Because my skin doesn't exist in a vacuum – it's connected to everything else that's happening in my body and my world. The app seemed to understand what I've been trying to tell dermatologists and beauty consultants for years: that my skin is complicated because my life is complicated.

The first photo I uploaded made me cringe. The app asked for a makeup-free selfie in natural light, and I almost deleted the whole thing right there. My skin looked angry and uneven, with the remnants of last week's breakout still visible as dark spots along my chin. But I forced myself to hit submit, because what did I have to lose at this point? Another $5 a month? I've wasted more than that on a single sheet mask that did nothing.

What happened next was both validating and terrifying. The AI analysis came back with observations that were so accurate they felt like personal attacks. "Appears to be experiencing hormonal fluctuations based on breakout pattern." "Skin barrier may be compromised from over-exfoliation." "Stress-related inflammation visible in T-zone." It was like the app had been watching me through my bathroom mirror for months, taking notes on all my failures.

But then came the recommendations, and they weren't what I expected. Instead of suggesting a complete overhaul of my routine (which I've tried countless times), it told me to stop using three of my current products immediately. Just stop. The glycolic acid toner that I'd been forcing myself to use because "everyone" said it was amazing? Gone. The clay mask I'd been using twice a week because I thought my skin needed "deep cleaning"? Banished. The vitamin C serum that made my skin tingle (which I'd convinced myself was "working")? Out.

The relief was immediate and confusing. I'd been so focused on adding things to my routine, on finding the magic product that would fix everything, that I'd never considered that maybe I was doing too much. Maybe my skin wasn't broken – maybe I was breaking it.

The new routine the app suggested was almost insultingly simple. A gentle cleanser I already owned. A basic moisturizer. Sunscreen. That's it. For someone who had been using eight different products twice a day, this felt like giving up. But it also felt like exhaling after holding my breath for years.

The first morning I followed the new routine, I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. Where was the active ingredient that would transform my skin? Where was the complex multi-step process that would prove I was taking this seriously? But there was just... simplicity. And for the first time in months, my skin didn't feel tight or irritated after cleansing. It felt like skin.

The app's daily check-ins became oddly addictive. Every morning, it asked how my skin looked and felt, but also how I'd slept, what I'd eaten, how stressed I was feeling. It was like having a therapist who specialized in skincare, connecting dots I'd never thought to connect. When I logged that I'd had a stressful day at work and eaten takeout for dinner, it gently suggested that tomorrow might be a good day for an extra hydrating step. When I mentioned that my period was starting, it warned me that I might see some hormonal breakouts in a few days and adjusted my routine accordingly.

The predictive features felt like magic at first, then like science. "Based on your cycle and stress levels, you may experience breakouts along your jawline in 2-3 days." And then, like clockwork, there they were. But this time, instead of feeling blindsided and defeated, I felt prepared. The app had already adjusted my routine to be gentler during this time, had reminded me to get enough sleep, had even suggested avoiding dairy for a few days.

For the first time in years, I felt like I had an ally in this fight instead of just more products to try.

But the skeptical part of my brain – the part that's been burned too many times – keeps waiting for the disappointment. It's only been three days. Three days of following a routine that feels too simple to work, of trusting an algorithm over my own anxious instincts, of resisting the urge to add "just one more" product to speed up the process.

The hardest part is the waiting. The app keeps reminding me that real change takes time, that my skin needs weeks to adjust and heal, that the damage from years of over-treatment won't disappear overnight. Intellectually, I know this is true. Emotionally, I want to see results now. I want proof that this time is different, that I haven't just found a more sophisticated way to disappoint myself.

I caught myself staring in the mirror this morning, looking for signs of improvement that couldn't possibly be there yet. My skin looks... the same. Maybe slightly less irritated, but that could be wishful thinking. The app gently reminded me that healing isn't always visible at first, that sometimes the most important changes happen beneath the surface.

The community features of the app have been unexpectedly comforting. Reading other people's journeys, seeing their progress photos, realizing that I'm not the only person who has struggled with this – it's like finding out you're not crazy after all. There's a woman named Jessica whose skin journey mirrors mine almost exactly, and seeing her three-month progress photos gives me something I haven't felt in a long time: realistic hope.

Not the desperate, grasping hope that comes with buying a new miracle product, but the steady, patient hope that comes from following a plan that makes sense. The app doesn't promise overnight transformation or miraculous results. It promises understanding, consistency, and gradual improvement. After years of chasing quick fixes, this feels revolutionary.

The anxiety is still there, but it's different now. Instead of the chaotic anxiety of not knowing what to do next, it's the focused anxiety of wanting something to work so badly that you're afraid to believe it might actually happen. I keep waiting for the app to glitch, for the recommendations to stop making sense, for this to reveal itself as just another expensive mistake.

But so far, every suggestion has felt thoughtful and personalized. When I logged that my skin felt tight after cleansing, the app immediately suggested a different cleanser from my existing products. When I mentioned that I was traveling for work, it adjusted my routine for airplane air and hotel water. It's like having a skincare expert who actually listens, who remembers what I've told them, who cares about the details of my specific situation.

The most surprising thing has been how much mental space this has freed up. Instead of spending hours researching new products and reading conflicting advice, I just follow the app's recommendations. Instead of second-guessing every decision, I trust the algorithm that's been trained on thousands of skin journeys like mine. It's not blind trust – I can see the reasoning behind every suggestion – but it's trust nonetheless.

I'm trying not to get ahead of myself. Three days is nothing in skincare time. My skin could still rebel against this new routine. The app could stop working as well as it has been. I could discover some fatal flaw that makes this just another expensive experiment. But for the first time in years, I'm not actively looking for reasons why something won't work.

Instead, I'm cautiously, carefully, allowing myself to hope that maybe – just maybe – I've found something that understands my skin as well as I want to understand it myself. Something that sees the bigger picture instead of just the surface problems. Something that treats my skin like part of a complex system instead of an isolated issue to be fixed with the right product.

The app reminded me today that consistency is more important than perfection, that small improvements compound over time, that healing is a process rather than an event. These aren't revolutionary concepts, but hearing them from something that's actually paying attention to my specific situation makes them feel true in a way they never have before.

I'm still scared. Scared that this won't work, scared that it will work but then stop working, scared that I'm setting myself up for another fall. But I'm also curious in a way I haven't been in years. Curious to see what my skin looks like when it's not constantly under attack from products that don't understand it. Curious to find out what happens when I stop fighting my skin and start working with it instead.

Tomorrow marks day four. The app says most people start seeing small improvements around week two, significant changes around week six. I've marked these dates in my calendar like appointments with hope. For now, I'm taking it one day at a time, one gentle routine at a time, one small act of faith at a time.

Maybe this time really will be different. Maybe I've finally found something that gets it, that gets me, that understands that my skin is just one part of a much larger, more complicated story. Maybe I'm not broken after all – maybe I just needed someone, or something, to help me put the pieces together in the right order.

The skeptical voice in my head is getting quieter, drowned out by something I haven't felt in years: the possibility that this nightmare might actually have an ending. Not a perfect ending, not a fairy tale transformation, but an ending where I'm not at war with my own face anymore.

That would be enough. That would be everything.


## Entry 3: After Using The Product
*July 18th, 9:15 PM*

I almost didn't recognize myself in the bathroom mirror this morning. Not because my skin is perfect – it's not, and I've finally made peace with that – but because of the way I looked at myself. There was no frantic searching for new problems, no catastrophic thinking about minor imperfections, no mental inventory of everything that was wrong. I just... looked. Saw my face. Smiled at what I saw. And went about my day.

It's been three and a half months since I started using GlowAI, and I'm writing this entry not from a place of desperation at 3 AM, but from my couch on a Sunday evening, feeling calm and grateful and almost disbelieving that this is my life now. The woman who wrote that first entry feels like a stranger to me, someone I want to reach back through time and hug, someone I want to tell that it's going to be okay, that the nightmare really does have an ending.

My skin isn't magazine-perfect. I still get the occasional breakout, especially around my period, but now I see it coming. The app predicts it with startling accuracy – "Hormonal fluctuations detected, expect minor breakouts in 2-3 days" – and I'm prepared. I adjust my routine slightly, I'm gentler with my skin, I don't panic. When the breakout appears, it's smaller than it used to be, heals faster, and doesn't send me spiraling into self-hatred and product-buying frenzies.

The transformation wasn't dramatic or sudden. There was no miracle moment where I woke up with glowing skin. Instead, it was a gradual shift, like watching a sunrise – you don't notice it happening until suddenly the whole sky is light. Week by week, my skin became calmer, more predictable, more responsive to the gentle routine the app had designed for me.

The first real sign that something was changing came around week six. I was getting ready for a video call and realized I hadn't checked my skin obsessively in the mirror that morning. I'd just washed my face, applied my simple routine, and moved on with my day. The constant background anxiety about my appearance had quieted to a whisper. I could focus on the actual content of the meeting instead of worrying about whether my camera angle was hiding my latest breakout.

By week eight, people started commenting. Not on my skin specifically – which would have made me self-conscious – but on how I looked overall. "You seem more relaxed lately." "You're glowing." "You look really good." I realized that the change wasn't just in my skin, but in how I carried myself. The hunched shoulders from constantly trying to hide my face had straightened. The nervous touching and checking had stopped. I was present in conversations instead of mentally cataloging my skin's imperfections.

The app's predictions became a source of empowerment rather than anxiety. When it warned me about potential stress-related breakouts during a particularly intense work project, I was able to adjust my routine proactively. I added an extra hydrating step, made sure to get enough sleep, and watched my skin sail through a period that would have previously left me looking like a teenager going through puberty. The sense of control was intoxicating after years of feeling helpless.

But the most profound change has been psychological. The mental space that skincare anxiety used to occupy has been freed up for other things. I read books again instead of skincare forums. I plan weekend trips without worrying about how travel will affect my skin. I accept last-minute invitations without needing to assess my face first. I've started dating again – really dating, not the careful, strategic version where I only saw people when my skin was cooperating.

My bathroom cabinet tells a different story now. Instead of a graveyard of failed products, it's a curated collection of items that actually work for my skin. The app helped me identify which of my existing products were helpful and which were harmful, saving me hundreds of dollars I would have spent on new purchases. The simplicity is beautiful – five products total, each with a clear purpose, each recommended specifically for my skin's current needs.

The financial relief has been enormous. I used to spend $100-200 a month on new skincare products, chasing the next miracle cure. Now I spend $15 on the app subscription and maybe $30 every few months to replace products I've actually used up. The app's partnership with brands means I can reorder exactly what I need with one click, no more wandering through Sephora in a confused haze, no more impulse purchases based on influencer recommendations.

I've become the friend people ask for skincare advice, which still feels surreal. Last week, my coworker Emma confided that she was struggling with adult acne and didn't know where to start. Instead of overwhelming her with product recommendations or sharing my horror stories, I simply told her about GlowAI. Watching her face light up as I described how the app works, seeing her download it immediately, felt like paying forward a gift I'd been given.

The community aspect of the app has been unexpectedly meaningful. Sharing progress photos and celebrating small victories with people who understand the journey has created connections I never expected. Jessica, whose story I followed during my early days, has become a real friend. We've met for coffee twice, bonding over our shared experience of skincare trauma and recovery. There's something powerful about being witnessed in your struggle and your healing by people who truly get it.

My relationship with mirrors has completely transformed. I used to avoid them or use them as weapons of self-criticism. Now they're just mirrors – tools for checking if I have food in my teeth or if my hair is sitting right. The harsh LED lights I installed in my bathroom to "see my skin clearly" have been replaced with warm, flattering bulbs. I don't need surgical lighting to examine every pore anymore because I'm not looking for problems to solve.

The app's gentle reminders have retrained my brain in ways I didn't expect. "Healing takes time." "Consistency over perfection." "Your skin is doing its best." These messages, delivered at just the right moments, have become internalized mantras. When I do get a breakout now, instead of spiraling into self-blame, I hear the app's voice reminding me that this is normal, temporary, part of the process.

Sleep has improved dramatically. I no longer lie awake at night feeling my face for new bumps or planning tomorrow's damage control. The app's evening check-ins have become a soothing ritual – logging how my skin felt that day, noting any changes, receiving gentle guidance for tomorrow. It's like having a bedtime story that's actually useful, a way to end each day with intention rather than anxiety.

Work presentations no longer fill me with dread. I scheduled a major client pitch for this Thursday without even thinking about what my skin might look like that day. The old me would have checked my calendar against my cycle, tried to predict potential breakouts, maybe even rescheduled if I thought my skin might not cooperate. Now I just... schedule meetings when they make sense. My skin is no longer the primary factor in my professional decisions.

The app's AI has learned my patterns so well that it feels like having a skincare therapist who never forgets anything I've told them. It remembers that I tend to break out when I eat too much dairy, that my skin gets dry when I travel, that stress shows up on my forehead before anywhere else. This personalized attention, this sense of being truly seen and understood, has been more healing than any product I've ever used.

I've started wearing less makeup, not because my skin is perfect, but because I'm no longer trying to hide from the world. A little concealer here and there, some mascara, and I'm good to go. The thick foundation and heavy concealer that used to be my armor have been replaced by confidence and self-acceptance. I take makeup-free selfies now, something that would have been unthinkable six months ago.

The ripple effects have extended far beyond skincare. The confidence I've gained from finally solving this problem has spilled over into other areas of my life. I applied for a promotion I'd been putting off, started a side project I'd been too insecure to pursue, booked a solo trip to Europe that I'd been dreaming about for years. When you stop being at war with your own face, you have so much more energy for everything else.

My relationship with my boyfriend has deepened too. I no longer cancel plans because of skin emergencies or spend our time together obsessing over my appearance. I'm present with him in ways I couldn't be before, when part of my attention was always focused on monitoring and managing my skin situation. He's noticed the change, tells me I seem lighter, more myself.

The app's streak feature, which initially seemed gimmicky, has become a source of quiet pride. 127 days of consistent, gentle skincare. 127 days of trusting the process instead of trying to force results. 127 days of treating my skin with kindness instead of aggression. The number represents more than just skincare consistency – it represents a fundamental shift in how I treat myself.

I still have the app, still follow its recommendations, still log my daily skin status. But it's become background noise now, a gentle guide rather than a lifeline. I don't need it to tell me what to do every day because I've internalized the lessons. I understand my skin now in a way I never did before – not just what products to use, but how it responds to stress, hormones, weather, lifestyle changes.

The woman who wrote that first diary entry was drowning in information but starving for understanding. She had all the knowledge but none of the wisdom. She was fighting a war she couldn't win because she didn't understand what she was fighting against. The app didn't just give me better products or a better routine – it gave me a better relationship with my own skin.

Looking back at my old photos, I can see the difference, but it's not just in my skin. It's in my posture, my expression, the way I hold my face. There's a relaxation there that wasn't present before, a comfort in my own skin that goes deeper than surface-level improvements. I look like someone who likes herself, someone who's made peace with her imperfections.

I think about all the money I spent, all the tears I cried, all the mental energy I wasted on this problem, and I feel a complex mix of emotions. Sadness for the years I lost to skincare anxiety. Anger at an industry that profits from confusion and insecurity. But mostly, I feel grateful. Grateful that I found something that worked, grateful that I didn't give up, grateful that the nightmare finally ended.

The app reminded me today that I'm approaching my four-month anniversary. It suggested I take a progress photo to compare with my starting point. I almost didn't – not because I'm ashamed of how I look, but because I don't need external validation anymore. My skin is my skin. It's healthy, it's calm, it's predictable. It's not perfect, but it's mine, and I've finally learned how to take care of it.

Tonight, as I write this, my face feels comfortable. Not tight, not irritated, not unpredictable. Just... comfortable. Like a well-fitting piece of clothing, like a room at the perfect temperature, like coming home after a long trip. This is what I was searching for all along – not perfection, but peace.

The bathroom mirror that used to be my enemy has become neutral territory. Sometimes I even smile at my reflection, not because my skin is flawless, but because I remember how far I've come. The woman looking back at me has been through a war and emerged victorious, not because she conquered her skin, but because she learned to work with it instead of against it.

I sleep well now. I wake up curious about the day ahead instead of dreading the mirror. I make plans without consulting my skin's schedule. I live my life instead of managing my appearance. This is what healing looks like – not dramatic transformation, but quiet revolution. Not perfection, but peace.

The app was just the beginning. The real work was learning to trust myself, to be patient with the process, to treat my skin – and myself – with the kindness I'd been withholding for years. The technology gave me the tools, but I had to do the healing.

And I did. We did. My skin and I, we figured it out together. Finally.
